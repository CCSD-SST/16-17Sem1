				I am a freshmen at Washington High School in Cherokee Iowa. Outside of school I enjoy plaing football, golf, and robotics
			Another thing I enjoy doing is coding and playing games. For example the game kingdom of loathing as shown in my background is 
			a game I play which was made by my teacher. In the game I am a turtle tamer which is a class where you tame turtles and can even
			throw the turtles at your enemy. In my future life I want to become a chemical engineer. At home I enjoy relaxing and playing with 
			my three cats named Nala, Coco, and Cow
