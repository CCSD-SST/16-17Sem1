			<font size="5"</font>
				I am a freshman at Washington High School in Cherokee Iowa. Outside of school I enjoy plaing football, golf, and robotics
			Another thing I enjoy doing is coding and playing games. For example the game kingdom of loathing is 	a game I play which was made
			by my teacher. In the game I am a turtle tamer which is a class where you tame turtles and can even	throw the turtles at your enemy.
			In my future life I want to become a chemical engineer. At home I enjoy relaxing and playing with my three cats named Nala, Coco, and Cow

			The way I got into the student tech team was mainly because of my brother and the how they were talking
			about it during ourrobotics practices. Another interesting fact about me is that my family takes trips 
			every summer in the past years we have gone to the Grand Canyon Yellowstone and all up the east coast.
			But this year is going to be our biggest trip yet. We are going to go to Greece.
