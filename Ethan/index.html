Curently I am an advaning programmer planning on learning every basic language and learnng my own way to do things. I understand that I'm not well known for any of the work I have done, but that is perfectly fine by me. Some of my work is just simply for viewing pleasure and I hope I can show you what I can do in the future. For now we need to work together to make the school the best we can, which is my reason for joining this course..";
